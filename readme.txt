These are files for no.258, a Mudkip ghost/ukagaka.

This ghost was initially created as a little birthday present. Time will tell if it gets any more development.

If you've never installed a Ghost before, read on:

*****How to Install*****

    The first thing you'll want to do is download and install SSP (http://ssp.shillest.net/ on Windows). While the site is in Japanese, just look for the "complete install package" download on the left. Download it somewhere and install it.
    When that's done, run SSP.exe, the program with the little bell icon. A catgirl named Emily should pop up and start talking to you in Japanese, and end up throwing up a big menu. For now, ignore all of that, and just close the menu when it appears. You can also hold down a key to speed through her text. She's the default Ghost that comes with SSP, if you're curious.
    Right-click the catgirl. It should bring up a long menu. If it's in English, then you have nothing to worry about. If it's not, go to the fourth option from the bottom, set it to English, then close the catgirl and reopen her. The right click menu should switch to English. The catgirl ghost will still be in Japanese though.
    Download the z_bluepearl.zip, the balloon that no.258 will be using.
    Drag and drop the z_bluepearl.zip onto the catgirl's face. It should look like she's installing something. She might tell you the balloon's name when she's done. If you right-click her and go to the Balloon tab, you should hopefully see the Pokemon Blue-Pearl balloon listed.
    Download the e_258.nar file. This is the actual Ghost.
    Drag and drop the e_258.nar file onto the catgirl. She should again look like she's installing something. She'll probably say No.258's name when she's done.
    Right-click Emily and go to the "Change Ghost" tab. You should now see No. 258 listed! Switch over to it and you should be ready to go. If it's not using the Blue-Pearl balloon, you can use the Balloon tab to switch him to it.

If you already have SSP coming into this, then all you have to do is drag and drop the respective balloon zip and nar onto your current ghost, and it'll install. 

****If you can't get Emily to install the files*****

What you can do instead is unpack the files manually. First, extract the z_bluepearl.zip, so you have a folder called "z_bluepearl". Then you'll want to go into SSP's balloon directory... it'd be under SSP\Balloon. You should see two folders in there called "ssp" and "emily4" if you're in the right place. Cut and paste the "z_bluepearl" folder into that folder. Then close and reopen Emily, and check if the Blue-Pearl balloon is listed. If so, then you're good!

For Mudkip, you'll want to do basically the same thing with the SSP/Ghost folder. First, extract the e_258.nar into a folder (a nar is basically a renamed zip file, any zip program should be able to unpack it. 7-zip can do it, for example). You should end up with a e_258 folder, and inside the folder there should be two subfolders, called "ghost" and "shell". If everything's in place, cut the "e_258" folder, and paste it into the ssp\ghost folder, so the ssp\ghost folder should now have both an emily4 folder, and a e_258 folder. Then close and reopen Emily, and see if No.258 is listed under "change ghost". If so, you're good!
