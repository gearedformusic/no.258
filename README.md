About
-------------------

This ghost was made as a present for a friend's birthday! It's a very basic ghost; it will mostly stand around and do cute things every 5 minutes or so. 
Double-click Mudkip to bring up a menu. From there you can check how it's doing (in actuality, run a random idle animation), feed it a PokeBlock, or pet it.
It doesn't have any actual meters for fullness or affection or anything, as of now it is very basic.
