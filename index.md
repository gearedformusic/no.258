## Welcome to No. 258!

These are files for no.258, a Mudkip ghost/ukagaka.This ghost was initially created as a little birthday present. Time will tell if it gets any more development. If you've never installed a Ghost before, read the Installation Guide. (https://github.com/gearedformusic/no.258/blob/master/Installation%20Guide.md#how-to-install)

### File Descriptions

    e_258.nar - The NAR file for the ghost. If you already have SSP installed, you can just drag and drop this file onto a ghost and download.
    z_bluepearl.zip - The balloon used for this ghost. Same as the NAR, you can drag and drop it to install if you already have SSP.
    Pokemon GB.ttf - The font used for the balloon. It was made to mimic the font used in Pokemon Red/Blue. Open it to install the font to your computer.
    README.md - The file you are reading now.
    Installation Guide.md - A guide to a first-time Ghost installation.
    e_258 folder - I'll probably delete this later when I'm sure I've got the hosting all sorted out. You can manually put this folder in your SSP directory to use the ghost.
