## Welcome to No. 258!

These are files for no.258, a Mudkip ghost/ukagaka.This ghost was initially created as a little birthday present. Time will tell if it gets any more development. If you've never installed a Ghost before, read the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/gearedformusic/no.258/blob/master/Installation%20Guide.md#how-to-install).

## File Descriptions

1. e_258.nar - The NAR file for the ghost. If you already have SSP installed, you can just drag and drop this file onto a ghost and download.
2. z_bluepearl.zip - The balloon used for this ghost. Same as the NAR, you can drag and drop it to install if you already have SSP.
3. Pokemon GB.ttf - The font used for the balloon. It was made to mimic the font used in Pokemon Red/Blue. Open it to install the font to your computer.
4. README.md - The file you are reading now.
5. Installation Guide.md - A guide to a first-time Ghost installation.
6. e_258 folder - I'll probably delete this later when I'm sure I've got the hosting all sorted out. You can manually put this folder in your SSP directory to use the ghost.

## Character

This is Pokemon Number 258, Mudkip. If you downloaded this ghost you probably already know who this is, but this is Mudkip, a Water-Type starter Pokemon for Generation 3 of the Pokemon video games.

## Features

## About

This ghost was made as a present for a friend's birthday! It's a very basic ghost; it will mostly stand around and do cute things every 5 minutes or so. Double-click Mudkip to bring up a menu. From there you can check how it's doing (in actuality, run a random idle animation), feed it a PokeBlock, or pet it.

## Acknowledgements

Big thanks to Zarla for her [Ghost Template](http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html), which I actually simplified even further for this ghost, and for her Pokemon Blue-Pearl balloon. Also thanks to [JoshR691](https://www.spriters-resource.com/submitter/JoshR691) for his custom Mudkip sprite sheet.
